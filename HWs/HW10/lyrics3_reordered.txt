Did you know Avril Lavigne was replaced by a lookalike named Melissa in
2003? At least, that?s what the internet would have you believe. The old
conspiracy theory that Lavigne was ?cloned? resurfaced on Twitter over
the weekend, but it has been bandied about the internet since 2005 and is
thought to have originated on a Brazilian fanpage.

The theory claims Lavigne, struggling with fame at the beginning of her
career, began using a body double named Melissa. At some point, the real
Lavigne is said to have died, so the record company replaced her with
Melissa full-time. ?Proof? has included Lavigne?s red carpet shots
(Lavigne wears trousers; Melissa prefers dresses and skirts) and supposed
differences between the facial features of pre-2003 Lavigne and the
current incarnation. Theorists also believe Melissa has left clues in
songs, such as Slipped Away, in which she sings: ?The day you slipped
away was the day I found it won?t be the same?. There was even a
publicity shot in which Lavigne had ?Melissa? written on her hand.
Spooky.
